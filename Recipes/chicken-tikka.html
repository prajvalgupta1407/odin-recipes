    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken tikka masala is usually made with heavy cream, but I like to use coconut milk instead; its subtle
        sweetness works beautifully with the spices in the dish. Serve with steamed rice.</p>
    <h2>How to make chicken-tikka</h2>
    <h3>ingredient</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons clarified butter (ghee), or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tikka Masala Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely grated ginger, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (13 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
        <li>½ cup chicken broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Place chicken in a bowl. Drizzle vegetable oil over chicken; toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Whisk together salt, garam masala, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and
            cardamom in a small bowl. Sprinkle over chicken and turn to coat evenly.

        </li>
        <li>Melt clarified butter in a large, heavy skillet over high heat. Cook chicken thighs in hot butter until
            browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate. When cool enough to handle, cut chicken
            into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Make sauce: Place the skillet with chicken drippings over medium-high heat. Stir onion into the skillet;
            sauté until onion softens and turns translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook until paste
            caramelizes, about 5 minutes. Stir garlic and ginger into tomato-onion mixture; cook until fragrant, about 1
            minute.</li>
        <li>Pour crushed tomatoes into the skillet. Bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the
            bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Pour in coconut milk and chicken broth; bring to a simmer, reduce
            heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend and sauce is slightly reduced,
            about 15 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Stir chicken and any accumulated juices into sauce. Add cilantro and red pepper flakes; bring to a simmer,
            reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until chicken is cooked through and tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Season
            with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ol>
